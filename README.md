# Hero-Fitness-Club-Application

The main objective of this project is to automate a gym or fitness centre for Hero fitness club, making its operations easier. It allows data and schedules for clients and employees easily available, as well as keeping records in a safe database simple. Before the new system can be used in a production environment, all history data must be loaded from the existing paper system. The FAST methodology, following several phases, will be used as a formal approach to develop and implement the system.
